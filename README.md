# JamesGallagher.io

## Background

This application is my professional portfolio powered by a GraphQL on Rails API and a React Single Page App (SPA). This portfolio has been constructed with a full CMS, allowing for the creation and administration of blog articles, portfolio projects, references, and inquiries through the site.

You can see the Portfolio API here: [jamesgallagher432/portfolio-api](https://github.com/jamesgallagher432/portfolio-api)

## Main Features

### Styled Components

This framework employs both css-modules and styled-components.  We feel that [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) is the best css-in-js library available.

### Grommet

[Grommet](https://grommet.github.io/) is the world's most advanced UX framework.  It contains hundreds of reusable UI components that you can use right away.

### GraphQL / Apollo

This framework includes some basic setup for GraphQL and ApolloClient.  You will have to setup your own GraphQL Server.  Alternatively, take a look at the [GraphQL Anywhere](https://github.com/apollostack/graphql-anywhere) package (not installed), which would allow you to process GraphQL queries client-side.

The setup includes the ability to generate the boilerplate to create GraphQL / ApolloClient queries and mutations within your containers.  It also adds the eslint-graphql-plugin to lint your collocated GraphQL queries / mutations.  The way it works is to load a schema.json file to create an AST of your GraphQL schema.  You will need to provide your own schema.json file and leave it in the `/config/schema/` folder.

Take a look at the [Example Apps](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate#example-apps) section to see examples of GraphQL configuration in practice.

If you do not need to use graphql, take a look at the [sans-apollo](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/scalable-react-boilerplate/tree/sans-apollo) branch for a reference implementation without GraphQL / Apollo.  

# Documentation

## Getting Started

To try the example application out or to use the project, follow the instructions below.

There are two options for installation:

1. **Clone repo**

   `git clone https://github.com/jamesgallagher432/jamesgallagherio.git`

2. **Install dependencies**

   `npm run setup`

3. **Create environment file**
   In order for the server and client to know which urls to connect to, we ask that you make a `.env` file.  We've included a `.env.example` file that you can rename to get started with the default values.

   `cp .env.example .env`

4. **Run development server**

   `npm run start`

   Your app will be served at: http://localhost:5000

## File Structure

Some files left out for brevity.  Please reference the files in the [Scalable React Boilerplate](https://github.com/RyanCCollins/feature-first-react-boilerplate) project for an example of the file structure.  The application will ultimately be in use in a production web application project and more info will be posted here when we have production level examples.

### Welcome to JamesGallagher.io! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my brand new website, JamesGallagher.io ðŸŽ‰. I built this website for two reasons: to reinforce and practice my current skills and; to showcase my current projects and experience. If there is any feedback you have for the site, please don't hesitate to shoot me [an email](/contact).

### About Me

I am a 15-year-old React Web Developer who develops high-performance applications using React, GraphQL, and Ruby on Rails. I started programming at age 9, and have since acquired knowledge in many different programming technologies, including those aforementioned, and others like Python and Git.

Currently I work as a freelance React Web Developer, working on many open-source projects using the most cutting-edge technologies available. Some of these projects are available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesgallagher432) page.

Previously, I was a Udacity mentor where I got the opportunity to help teach hundreds of students about programming in React, and share my acquired knowledge and best practices. This position allowed me to not only refine my skills, but also better develop my intrapersonal skills including communication and teamwork. This position also gave me the ability to review projects of dozens of students, from resumes, to React websites, allowing me to learn more about code reviewing and best practices in React.

Moreover, I am also very educated about startups and growth, taking the time to read publications like TechCrunch and comment on startup advice on my [blog](https://www.jamesgallagherio.com/blog). My range of knowledge expands from community and marketing, to engineering practices and starting a business.

In my spare time I like to keep up to date with the current goings on in the world, from politics to technological advancements, and love to discuss and share my knowledge with anyone who will listen. I am also very active in a variety of communities, including the GraphQL and Ruby Slack group, as well as the ProductHunt community.

#### Mentoring

Writing clean and high-quality code is very important to your success as an engineer, no matter what your job title is. If you want to improve the quality of your code, or need guidance on a new subject like React, or Redux, please get in touch and I would be happy to help in any way I can.

I am currently looking for a position as either a Junior React Web Developer, Back-End Web Developer, or a Community Manager. You can view my experience all throughout this site and on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jamesgallagher432) page.

I hope you enjoy using this new portfolio site, and find it useful to you if you are looking to read my blog posts or just view my portfolio. Good day!  ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
